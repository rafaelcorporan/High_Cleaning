# Cloudflare Pages Redirects
# Note: Cloudflare Pages serves existing files first, then applies redirects

# Calculator login page
/cal  /cal/  301

# Calculator app SPA routes
/cal/app  /cal/app/  301
/cal/app/*  /cal/app/index.html  200

# Legacy redirect from old path
/calculator  /cal/  301
/calculator/*  /cal/  301

# Main site SPA fallback - serve index.html for non-existent routes
/*    /index.html   200

# API routes are handled by Cloudflare Workers in /functions
# No redirects needed - they're automatically routed
