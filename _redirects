# Cloudflare Pages Redirects
# Note: Cloudflare Pages serves existing files first, then applies redirects

# Calculator SPA routes - only applies when file doesn't exist
# Static assets in /calculator/_next/* are served directly
/calculator  /calculator/  301
/calculator/*  /calculator/index.html  200

# Main site SPA fallback - serve index.html for non-existent routes
/*    /index.html   200

# API routes are handled by Cloudflare Workers in /functions
# No redirects needed - they're automatically routed
