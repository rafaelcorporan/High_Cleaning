Design a premium, modern corporate flyer for a cleaning company named High Cleaning — Real Cleaning Solutions.
Format: Bi-fold flyer (8.5″ × 5.5″ when flat).
Style: Sophisticated, clean, trustworthy — not generic or “cheap cleaning service”. Think corporate wellness brand, not discount vendor. 
🖼️ VISUAL DIRECTION 

    Color Palette:  
        Primary: Deep navy blue #2E5A88 (trust, professionalism)  
        Secondary: Teal #4ECDC4 (freshness, precision)  
        Background: Soft off-white #F7F9FC (purity, calm)  
        Accent text: Dark charcoal #1A2238 (authority)
         
    Fonts:  
        Headlines: Space Grotesk Bold (modern, geometric, premium)  
        Body: Inter Regular (clean, highly readable, corporate-friendly)
         
    Imagery:  
        Use abstract, minimalist backgrounds — NO mops, brooms, before/after dirt, or smiling cleaners.  
        Acceptable: Soft watercolor washes (navy → teal), subtle geometric grids, clean office line drawings.  
        If using photos: Only high-end, well-lit corporate interiors (empty desks, glass partitions, marble lobbies) — no people.
         
    Icons: Line-style, minimalist, consistent stroke width (1.5–2px). Use Canva’s “Outline Icons” set.
