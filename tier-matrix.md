2. **Operational Overhead**: +28% (insurance, equipment, supplies, management)
3. **Annual Discount**: -15% (for 12-month contracts)

**Example Calculation** (Tier 2: Hygiene+ Certified - Small):

Base: $25/hr × 1 staff × 100 hrs = $2,500
Overhead: $2,500 × 28% = $700
Subtotal: $3,200
Annual Discount: $3,200 × 15% = $480
Final Price: $2,720 ≈ $1,200/mo (rounded for simplicity)
